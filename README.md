# Aws-Security-App
In this project, a comprehensive security application was developed within the scope of a computer engineering graduation project using AWS, ESP-32 Cam microcontroller, and a Native Android Application. Briefly describing the application, when a person approaches the ESP-32 Cam module, the camera activates, captures the person's image, and sends it to AWS in base64 format via the MQTT protocol. The image sent to IoT Core triggers lambda functions, where facial recognition comparison is performed with the individuals stored in S3. If the face is not recognized, a notification is sent to the user's phone along with the captured image. If the user declares "I do not know this person," a buzzer connected to ESP32 activates. On the other hand, if the user declares "I know this person," the recognized face is saved to S3, and no notification is sent when that person comes again. Additionally, the user can upload person profiles to S3 via their mobile application.
